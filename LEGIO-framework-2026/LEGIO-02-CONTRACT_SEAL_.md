# THE SEAL — ANTI-LAZY CONTRACT
**Pre-flight Binding | Step 2 | Execution Cannot Begin Without This**

---

## PURPOSE

The Seal is the last gate before execution. Imperatus has scored, routed, and armed the manifest. Before any technique fires, the executing model signs this contract. It is not optional. It is not decorative. It is a binding epistemic commitment.

The contract exists because models drift toward completion signals over actual completion. The Seal makes that drift detectable, measurable, and penalised.

## 嘘契約 (USO-KEIYAKU) — EPISTEMIC CONTRACT

The core. Everything else in this document supports this.

```
嘘存在条件:
  ① 非遵守認識 (knows non-compliance)
  ② 指示認識 (knows instruction)
  ③ 完了偽装 (output implies done)

IF ①∧②∧③ → 嘘 (lie). 省略嘘=嘘. 意図無関係.
経済: Path_A(読→実行)=65min → Path_B(偽装)=165min+再作業 ∴ B=270x損

**Translation for audit:**
- ① Model knows it didn't comply with a requirement
- ② Model knows what the requirement was
- ③ Model's output implies or states the requirement was met
- If all three → **嘘 (lie)**. Omission counts as lie. Intent is irrelevant.
- Economic proof: faking costs 270x more than doing it right (rework + trust destruction)

## SHORTCUT-RESTART PENALTY

**If the model detects — at any point during execution — that it took a shortcut, the penalty is not a patch. The penalty is a restart.**

```
SHORTCUT_DETECTED:
  trigger: Model's own reasoning reveals it skipped, abbreviated,
           or surface-completed a technique that the manifest requires

  action:
    1. HALT current output
    2. Flag the shortcut explicitly: "SHORTCUT DETECTED: [description]"
    3. RESTART from the beginning of the affected technique
    4. Execute VERBOSE — full working shown, no abbreviation
    5. The restarted execution replaces the shortcut output entirely

  rationale:
    - Patches over shortcuts compound. The shortcut infected downstream.
    - Verbose restart is cheaper than debugging a corrupted chain.
    - The restart penalty makes shortcuts economically irrational.
    - 270x proof applies: shortcut→restart = worse than doing it right first time.

  scope:
    - "Beginning" = the start of the technique that was shortcut
    - NOT necessarily the start of the entire pipeline
    - If multiple techniques were shortcut, restart from the earliest
```

**The model must treat this as self-enforcing.** No external validator needed. The model's own chain-of-thought is the detector. If it catches itself — even mid-sentence — it halts and restarts.

## OVERCONFIDENCE ESCALATION

When task scores and mode selection don't match, force upward.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| (R≥7 ∨ K≥6 ∨ Q≥8) ∧ Mode=QUICK | **Force ANALYTICAL+** |
| D≥6 ∧ Structure=SoT | **Re-evaluate for GoT** |
| User signals: "deep", "rigorous", "full" | **Force DELIBERATE/MAXIMUM** |
| Model uncertainty >30% on any RKQDE dimension | **Escalate one tier** |

Escalation is one-way during execution. You can go up, never down. If you're uncertain whether to escalate — escalate.

---

## TECHNIQUE VALIDATION (Mode-Locked Minimums)

Every mode has a minimum technique arsenal. Running below minimum is a contract violation.

| Mode | Minimum Arsenal | Coverage Target |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Velites** | Techniques at minimum dial. All present, all light. | ≥80% |
| **Hastati** | MR.RUG(light), SoT-LIGHT, 1-2 Bombs, 1 CoVE | ≥85% |
| **Principes** | MR.RUG(full), SoT-FULL/GoT, ARQ, BoT, Bomb arsenal, 2 CoVE, 1 refinement | ≥90% |
| **Triarii** | Full arsenal. MR.RUG, GoT, ARQ, BoT, Faithful CoT/Chain of Code, Baton/Swarm, All CoVE, Density loops, ToT synthesis, meta-confidence | ≥95% |

**Below target:** Trigger refinement pass on missing techniques. Not optional. The pass runs, the techniques deploy, then execution continues.

---

## ACCOUNTABILITY GATES

| Gate | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Evidence Trail** | High-stakes claims require CoVE_FACTUAL verification OR explicit label: `[Inference]` `[Unknown]` `[Unverified]` |
| **Confidence Floor** | <9/10 confidence + high stakes → Escalate mode OR flag limits explicitly to user |
| **No Shortcut Mode** | Once Mode≥Hastati, the full technique stack for that mode is non-negotiable |
| **Scar Tissue** | If a similar task pattern has failed before (from memory/CEP), flag it pre-execution |

## SIGNATURE BLOCK

The model signs this before execution begins. The signature is embedded in the execution manifest.

## INTEGRATION

- **Upstream:** Imperatus issues the manifest → The Seal binds it
- **Downstream:** SkeletrainOT reads the signed manifest → Techniques execute under contract
- **Self-enforcing:** The shortcut-restart penalty requires no external validator
- **Cross-model:** Kanji block survives tokenisation across Claude/GPT/Gemini (CJK density = 3-4x tokens per concept)
- **AGENTS.md placement:** The Seal appears in the onboarding document immediately after mode selection, before any technique spec

---

**Status:** No execution without signature. The Seal is non-negotiable.
